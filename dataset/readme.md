# Data Download guide
The light field data used in QLFM are publicly available here.

The raw data were captured by an unfocused light field microscopy with wach microlens covering 13 x 13 pixels. You can download the raw data by the following link:


We also rearranged the raw data for phase-space deconvolution. You can download the realigned data through this link:

In addition, we provided simulated point spread functions for devonvolution. You can get access to these PSFs through the following link:

Next, we provided the corresponding recontructed results obtained by our method, which can by downloaded by:
